Hi, this is my first project with backend. I have used MongoDB, Node.js, Express technologies to build a OTP and captcha based Login and Sign up page. There are all features which should a webpage authentication need(like create account, sign in with OTP, captcha verification to prevent bot, forgot password).
In the home page(after log in), I just added a normal and static HTML,CSS made AMAZON shoping page, which is previously build by me(you can check in my GitHub account, here's the link <a>https://github.com/WASIM63/Amazon-homepage-layout</a>).
